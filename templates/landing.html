        <p>Based on the importance 
            of enhancing and maintaining a person’s natural beauty, Nails and Smiles was 
            founded by Jaga in September 2016 after she noticed a 
            demand for premium nail care in top sanitation environment
            that offer both a relaxing and cozy experience.<br/><br/>
            She believes that women should have strong, beautiful and most 
            importantly real nails obviating the need for extensions which destroy nail beds.<br/><br/>

        <p>Our customers' nail health is really important for us. To provide top sanitary service for everyone we
            use new files, new buffs and new pumice for each service. For pedicures, we use disposable 
            plastic liners to prevent any health problems. Our metal tools are sanitized after each service 
            by following Illinois salon sanitation requirements. <br/><br/>We do all this so you can just relax while getting pampered.
